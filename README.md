# Simple Smartwatch project
A project where i design and build my own simple smartwatch. It not intended to be a super complex product, offering little more functionality than a standard analog watch. In this project I design the UI in Figma, aquire the necessary hardware, code it in the Arduino IDE with assistance from Squareline Studios, and design the casing for the watch itself.

I am currently wokring on making a simple battery level indicator, that shows when the battery charge is either at a Low, Medium or High level, so that i can know when to charge the watch and when to unplug it.

I am also beginning to play around with the shape for the watch case, now that I have an overview of the hardware I need to accomodate for.
